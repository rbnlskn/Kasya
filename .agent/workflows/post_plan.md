1. [Manual] Ensure `implementation_plan.md` is ready and user approved.
2. [Manual] Read the content of `implementation_plan.md`.
3. Post Plan to Issue: `gh issue comment ${INPUT_ISSUE_ID} --body "(Paste Plan Content Here)"`
4. [CRITICAL] **STOP AND WAIT**. Do not proceed to `/init_feature` or any other step until the user explicitly approves the posted plan in the chat (e.g., "Plan looks good", "Proceed").
