WORKFLOW ALIGNMENT PLAN
========================

GOAL:
Align the local development steps with GitHub processing to ensure a smooth, automated, and error-free workflow.

USER REVIEW REQUIRED:
INSTRUCTIONS: This file outlines the *Current State*. Please EDIT the "Proposed Changes" sections 
(or the Current State directly) to define how you *want* the workflow to look.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ISSUE LIFECYCLE
------------------
Current State:
- Trigger: User adds "ready" label to a GitHub Issue.
- Assignment: Automation assigns the Issue to the actor (Agent/User).
- Planning: Agent posts plan -> User approves -> Label becomes "in progress".

Proposed Changes:
(Edit here: Do you want to remove the 'ready' label? Change how planning works?)
[Use current process]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. VERSIONING STRATEGY
----------------------
Current State:
- Start of Feature: Manual "npm run bump:minor" (Increments Y, resets Z).
- During Development: "npm run bump:patch" (Increments Z).
- Rules: Patch bumps are currently skipped if on the "main" branch.

Proposed Changes:
(Edit here: Should versioning be fully automated? Should we stop bumping per commit?)
[Use current process]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. MOBILE VERIFICATION
----------------------
Current State:
- Sync: "npx cap sync" (Copies web assets to Android).
- Open: "npx cap open android" (Opens Android Studio).
- Build: Manual build in Android Studio (Build APK).
- Test: Manual install on emulator/device.

Proposed Changes:
(Edit here: Do you want an automated command to build the APK without opening Studio?)
[Use current process]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. PR & MERGE
-------------
Current State:
- Creation: Agent runs "/push_and_build" (Type-check -> Push -> Build Web -> Sync -> Open Studio -> Create PR).
- CI: Runs Playwright tests and Type-check on PRs to "main".
- Merge: Squash & Merge ("/merge_and_close").
- Closure: Merging automatically closes the linked Issue.

Proposed Changes:
(Edit here: Add more checks? Change merge strategy?)
[Use current process]
