# Agent Guidelines

## 1. Project Overview
This is a personal project. Please help me maintain and update the code.

## 2. Work Process (CRITICAL)
- **Automatic Review:** When you have finished a task, **ALWAYS** open a Pull Request (PR).
- **Verification:** Do not merge the PR yourself. I (the user) will review the code to check if it is fixed.
- **Testing:** Include a brief explanation in the PR of how I can test your changes.

## 3. Coding Standards
- Write clean, commented code.
- If you change a feature, ensure it doesn't break existing functionality.
